# **Face Recognition**

It uses the very basic of Viola - Jones Algorithm to detect Haar like features of the face and eyes.

It takes the the input in form of a video feed using webcam, which is then segmented into frames. For each frame I apply the Viola - Jones Algorithm to detect a face and eyes.
